# CollabAI
In today's AI-driven workplace, teams face a critical coordination challenge: when multiple team members use AI assistants independently, they receive inconsistent responses, lose shared context, duplicate efforts, and struggle to maintain alignment. This fragmentation leads to inefficient decision-making and poor team coordination.

Solution :

CollabAI is a collaborative AI workspace platform that enables teams to interact with multiple AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) simultaneously within shared conversations. Every team member sees the complete discussion thread, AI responses are displayed side-by-side for comparison, and context is preserved across the entire team—creating a single source of truth for AI-assisted collaboration.
